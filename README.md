  ## Description
  This readme was generated with this program! The readme generator uses a command line interface to record user input and then automatically formats the responses in a Markdown file. The generated sections are broken down into Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, Tests, and License. Async functions handle the promises generated by the user prompts and the fs.writeFile method is used to generate a README.md file. Links, images, and badges are included as essential parts of a good readme. 
  ## Installation
  This package relies on Inquirer and the built in Util and FileSystem packages. Run the following terminal command to complete the necessary installs: ```npm i```
